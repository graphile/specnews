        June 2022's working-group-meeting saw the closure of a number of action
        items, the introduction of a new "composite schemas" working group, a
        discussion around an “experimental” directive, a new validation rule to
        assert operation types exist, an update on the client-controlled
        nullability, oneOf, and "unions implementing interfaces" RFCs and a
        number of spicy takes on the GraphQL spec itself!
