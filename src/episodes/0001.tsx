        April 2022’s working group saw the announcement of the GraphQL
        Foundation’s first conference, a preview of the future direction of
        GraphiQL, a proposal to allow unions to implement interfaces, and a
        discussion of the payload format to use for streams. Jem and Benjie give
        you the lowdown.
